## Problem domain

The user needs a platform to find and share movies, with a gamified element that helps build their profile and makes the user experience fun.

## User stories (MVP)

- As a user, I would like to be able to find movies via catagory.
- As a user, I would like to share comments on the movie page.
- As a user, I would like to be able to log in to my profile.
- As a user, I would like to be able to view a trailer.
- As a user, I would like to be able to view movie information.
- As a user, I would like to be able to use the app on a variety of devices.

## Stretch user stories

- As a user, I would like to share movie comments on my profile and have other people visit and visit other peoples.
- As a user, I would like the gamified element to have achievements, a sense of humour and badges to display on profile. (Consider using toast component)
- As a user, I would like to have my content dynamically showed to me to make suggestions for movies that I like. (Recommendations)
- As a user, I would like to see a list of what‚Äôs currently popular or new.
